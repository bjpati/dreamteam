## About dreamTeam

Dream Team is an application used for users to have information about their favourite players. Users are able to build a team from 10 players and one goalkeeper. The user can choose the players that are provided by API and get them to the team to build thier own team. Then it is possible to see the player information such as image, name, nationality, team, last transitions and other highlighted information that can be interesting. 
## Done until now

Until know we have deployed the App and can extract data from the API. We have chosen an existing free API which fulfill the requirements that we set up in this project. We have created most of the files such as sideparPresenter, SidebarView, searchPresenter and so on. The structure of our project is almost the same as what we did in the labs. As we did in the labs, we have some function for promises. 

## To Do

We will fix the search sidebar that is shown on the left side of the home page. And the information sidebar that is shown on the right side of the page and provides the player's information. In addtion, we should creaet the login/ signup app side and save the user data in the database using the firebase real-time database
